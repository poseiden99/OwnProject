### Introduction


### Have you worked in stream processing, generative AI?
### Explain your current project.
### Tell me your downstream and upstream systems.

### yo have mentioned about indexing, do you know which searching algorithm does it follow when there is index on.

### Suppose there is a Spark job that is running since last 2 hours and generally it takes 3 hours to complete. But all of sudden at around 2.30 it got failed. what i want to know is

### Fuzzy Matching, How do you do it and how do you make sure that it's not giving you a false positive.

### Your git workdlow or in other sense let's say you have been a new item to work on. what are the steps do you follow in order to deliver it.

### Suppose we want to process 100 GB of data. Tell me the Spark configuration you would use in order to get it processed without any issue. Number of executor nodes, total memory, executor memory, number of executor cores. - Same but different question, suppose there is upstream system.

### you have mentioned that you have used API as one of your data source. could you please walk me through the implementaion, I want to know how would you do it in data bricks. keep it in mind that you will be doing icremental load.

### Tell me couple of data quality checks that you have applied including the complex one and how did you do it.

### Let's suppose your Spark Job was working fine on development, but as soon as you deployed it to other env, support pre-prod, it started running slow. How would you do root cause anaylsis and how would you approach fixing the problem. so that i works on both dev as well as pre-prod.

### tell me the variety of data you have worked with as in the format of file or type of structured or unstructured data.
